It is good practice to make a sprite face right by default 
IF it is going to be ROTATING, because 0 degrees is to the right. If you don't do this and you rotate 90 degrees for example, the sprite won't be facing up .

Script functions are global, reference them directly. 
Event functions are isolated to the event like var.

Middle click things to reference them in the manual. 

Objects and stuff in the asset browser are also global variables you can use in your code. (but they don't use 'global.')

"random(4)" will return a number between 0 and 4 inclusive. 
"irandom(4)" will return an integer between 0 and 4 inclusive 
"random(2,4)" same thing but in a range
"irandom(2,4)" same thinb ut in a range.

It's good to make important objects as parent objects. These have no difference except they can inheret children objects. 
One example would be the collision object.

"with()" only references the instance, not the object
If you provide an instance ID to the "with" function it will modify the specific instance.
However if you provide the object name, it will loop over every single instance of that object. 
It will only impact instances that are already created, not ones created after. 

application surface size is like the render size, if surface size and window size are bigger than the game, it will render sub-pixels.
Set application surface size to same as camera/viewport if you don't want upscaling
